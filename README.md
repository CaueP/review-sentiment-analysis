# Sentiment Analysis of Reviews
This is my first experiment with Machine Learning, in which the main objective is to train the machine using Naive Bayes algorithm to classify a review, informing whether it's a positive or negative review. Thus, the problem statement is: "A review received is positive or negative?"

The code and results can be found in this workbook: [sentiment-analysis.ipynb](sentiment-analysis.ipynb)

# Machine Learning Workflow
The following steps were followed to achieve the goal of this project:

## Problem statement
Defined the problem statement: "A review received is positive or negative?"

## Feature
Selected the data set collected on UCI archive to be used and represented it using numerical attributes

## Model training
Trained the model with the training data and choose the traning algorithm Naive Bayes.

## Test
Tested the model with test data
